#Network Architectures#
***********************
- SSNet : The baseline single stream saliency networks. Utilizes only spatial (appearance) information and accepts still video frames.
- TSNet : Exploits only temporal information whose input is given in the form of optical flow images. 
- STSMaxNet : Performs fusion by using element-wise max fusion.
- STSConvNet : Employs convolutional fusion after the fifth convolution layers.
